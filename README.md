# commute-planning
### A personal project for apartment hunting

My partner got a new job near Boston! There are a couple of places we'll have to commute to semi-regularly, so I made this interactive map to check the commute times between each and hopefully narrow the apartment hunt.

The town boundaries are from the MA Bureau of Geographic Information, the basemaps are from Stamen, and the commute times are calculated via Google Maps. I'm not posting the data used to generate it, but here's the plotting code and an example of the output.
